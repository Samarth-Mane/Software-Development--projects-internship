## 1️⃣ Text-Based Game

**🎯 Objective:** Create a guessing or quiz game using conditional statements to control the game flow

**✨ Features**
- Console-based interaction  
- Simple game rules for quick play  
- Uses `if-else` statements for game flow  

---

## 2️⃣ Number Pattern Generator

**🎯 Objective:** Develop a program that generates and displays number patterns (such as pyramids or triangles) using loops and nested loops.  

**✨ Features**
- Generates various number patterns like pyramids
- Accepts user input for pattern size  
- Uses nested loops for structure control  

---

## 3️⃣ Task Manager Console Application (CRUD)

**🎯 Objective:** Implement a menu-driven console application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks stored in an in-memory list or array.  

**✨ Features**
- Create, view, update, and delete tasks  
- Menu-driven interface for easy navigation  
- Stores tasks temporarily in memory during runtime  

---

## 4️⃣ Temperature Converter

**🎯 Objective:** Build a program that converts temperature values between Celsius and Fahrenheit, allowing users to select the conversion direction.  

**✨ Features**
- Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit  
- Allows user to choose conversion direction  
- Includes input validation for accuracy  

---

## 5️⃣ Persistent Task Manager (File I/O)

**🎯 Objective:** Enhance the CRUD-based Task Manager by implementing file handling to store tasks persistently and load them when the application starts.  

**✨ Features**
- Saves tasks to a text file for future use  
- Loads existing tasks automatically at program start  
- Handles file read/write errors gracefully
